<h1>Education</h1>
	<p>I have done my O’ levels and A’ levels from LGS (Lahore Grammar School). Academically, I've always been a determined and ambitious student. I have developed a solid foundation in math, physics, and information technology throughout my studies. I'm delighted to say that I scored all As on both my O' level and A’ level examinations, which, in my opinion, illustrates my capacity for academic excellence. I've always found computer science to be fascinating, and I'm keen to further my knowledge and abilities in this sector. I am currently enrolled in Computer science at ITU.</p>
