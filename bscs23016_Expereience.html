	<p align="center">The ability to learn and adapt is critical to success. To thrive, one must constantly learn and change. My desire to learn new things stems from a strong feeling of curiosity. I've discovered that my urge to study is a self-perpetuating loop, since each new piece of knowledge I gain simply fuels my desire to learn even more. It's a wonderful feeling to be constantly growing, learning and evolving as a person. My desire to learn more about computer science is driven by a passion for discovery and a desire to make a meaningful impact. I used some tutorials and my persistent passion for programming to create a simplistic 3-D platform game named “CUBISTIC”. I put effort into building replica of some well-known video games "Flippy Knife" and "Color Switch" using Build box. These experiences solidified my desire to pursue a career in this field and have helped me develop valuable skills. It is indeed fairly evident my intense desire to always learn. I feel that through expanding my knowledge of this profession, I will be able to contribute to its advancement and help shape the future in positive ways.</p>
