	<p class="p1" > Hi, my name is Subhan. My passion for technology began at a young age, and as I grew older it just escalated, I became increasingly interested in the field of Computer Science and its ability to solve complex problems and create new possibilities. I used my spare time in high school to take some online courses and pursue my interest in programming. We all play games but have we ever wondered about the backend. Portraying a virtual world into such a realistic experience on a portable device like a mobile phone is a true definition of art. I'm fascinated by how designers create stunning graphics and dynamics in the game to deliver the best user experience possible.</p>
